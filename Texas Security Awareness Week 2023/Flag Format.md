The platform contains a number of hacking challenges where you can test your skills across web security, cryptography, digital forensics, reverse engineering annd exploitation by solving problems to recover flags. Unless otherwise stated in the challenge description, all flags will follow the format of `texsaw{string}.`

Once you solve a challenge and obtain the flag, you can submit it. For example, you can solve this challenge right now by submitting the flag `texsaw{y0uG0tM3}`.
