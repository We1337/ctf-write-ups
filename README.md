**What it is:** CTF write-ups are documents or blog posts written by participants of a CTF (Capture The Flag) competition, in which they describe their experience and thought process while solving the challenges presented during the competition. These write-ups typically include detailed explanations of the steps taken to solve the challenges, as well as any tools or techniques used to accomplish the objectives. CTF write-ups can be helpful resources for others who are interested in learning more about the field of cybersecurity and improving their own skills in this area.
